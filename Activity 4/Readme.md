### Scenario 1: Fuel Monitoring System for Transport Depot

## Problem Overview

A government transport depot maintains fuel tanks used for operating buses. Since uninterrupted fuel availability is critical for daily transport services, fuel levels must be monitored continuously. Any abnormal fuel condition can lead to service disruption or safety risks.
The system must generate alerts based on predefined fuel level thresholds so that depot managers and staff can take timely and appropriate action.

## Objective of the Fuel Monitoring System

The main objectives of this system are:

* To monitor fuel levels in real time
* To generate alerts when fuel levels cross critical limits
* To ensure operational continuity and safety
* To assist depot managers in decision-making

## Fuel Level Conditions and Alerts

The system categorizes fuel levels into three conditions:

| Fuel Level Condition   | System Alert     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Below reserve level    | Low fuel alert   |
| Within safe limits     | Normal status    |
| Above maximum capacity | Overflow warning |

## Working of the Alert System

### 1. Fuel Level Input

* The system receives the current fuel level from sensors or manual input.
* Predefined thresholds are set for:

  * Reserve fuel level
  * Maximum safe capacity

### 2. Alert Evaluation Logic

* If the fuel level falls below the reserve level:

  * The system generates a low fuel alert.
  * Managers are notified to arrange refueling immediately.
* If the fuel level is within the safe operating range:

  * The system displays a normal status message.
  * No action is required.
* If the fuel level exceeds the maximum safe capacity:

  * The system generates a warning alert.
  * Staff are alerted to prevent overflow and safety hazards.

### 3. Alert Generation

* Alerts are displayed clearly on the system interface.
* Each alert indicates the nature of the issue and urgency.
* This allows quick response and corrective action.

## Importance of Alerts in Fuel Monitoring

* Prevents fuel shortages that can disrupt transport services
* Avoids fuel overflow and potential fire hazards
* Helps in planning fuel procurement efficiently
* Improves safety and reliability of depot operations

## Key Advantages of This Design

* Ensures continuous monitoring of critical resources
* Provides early warnings for abnormal conditions
* Reduces operational risks
* Easy to extend for logging, notifications, or automation
* Suitable for government and large-scale transport systems

## Real-World Relevance

Such fuel monitoring and alert systems are commonly used in:

* Government transport depots
* Logistics and fleet management systems
* Industrial fuel storage facilities
* Smart infrastructure monitoring systems

## Conclusion

The Fuel Monitoring System effectively applies inventory alert concepts to manage fuel resources in a transport depot. By generating alerts for low fuel, normal conditions, and overflow situations, the system ensures safety, efficiency, and uninterrupted transport services. This approach demonstrates the practical application of inventory alerts in real-world operational environments.
